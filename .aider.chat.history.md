Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can edit its title and description. Once that file is added, I’ll also create the `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file for the app logo.

A modern, minimalist logo for an NFT rarity tracking app. The logo features a stylized, abstract representation of a digital collectible: a geometric shape resembling a stylized NFT token, with subtle gradient colors (blue to purple) and a small sparkle effect to convey rarity. Below or beside the icon, the text "NFT Rarity Tracker" is written in a clean, sans-serif font, with the word "Rarity" highlighted in a contrasting color to emphasize the app's focus. The background is a soft gradient from light gray to white, giving a professional and tech‑savvy look.
